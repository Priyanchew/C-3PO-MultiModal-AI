# 🤖 C-3PO MultiModal AI

C-3PO (Compact Plug-and-Play Proxy Optimization) is a **Perplexity-like multi-modal AI assistant** that integrates search, chat, image generation, document parsing, and various Hugging Face models—all in one place.

This isn't just an AI agent. It's your next-gen **knowledge navigator**—capable of **retrieving**, **creating**, and **conversing**, across text, image, audio, and documents.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 AI Assistant (Perplexity Style)
- Conversational assistant with access to **live search**
- Generates cited, grounded responses
- Asks clarifying questions and refines search dynamically

### 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Uses **SearxNG** for web search
- Intelligent document chunking & semantic similarity search
- Integrated with **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and other tools

### 🧾 Document Understanding
- Drag-and-drop PDFs, URLs, scanned documents
- Parses and summarizes documents intelligently
- Supports chunking, token counting, and visual previews

### 🎨 Hugging Face Integration
- Text-to-Image generation with models like **Stable Diffusion**
- Text classification, sentiment, summarization, translation & more
- Powered by Transformers with plug-and-play model support

### 🧠 Whisper + Audio/Video Input
- Upload or record audio/video
- Transcribes and generates Q&A from audio content

### 🖼 Visual Chat
- Upload images, ask questions about them
- Visual grounding with captioning and VQA (Visual Question Answering)

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **AI Models**: HuggingFace Transformers, Stable Diffusion, Whisper
- **Search**: SearxNG
- **Orchestration**: LangChain, LlamaIndex
- **Database**: ChromaDB / Local JSON for vector search
- **Infra**: Docker, NGINX, Python Microservices

## 🧪 Demo Use Cases

- 🤖 Ask: *“Summarize the latest paper on Quantum Cryptography and generate an image inspired by its key themes.”*
- 📄 Upload a research PDF, and get: *“Slide-ready summaries + visuals.”*
- 🖼 Upload an image, and ask: *“What's happening here?”*
- 🔗 Paste a URL and ask: *“Summarize this page and translate it into French.”*
